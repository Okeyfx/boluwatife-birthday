    <p data-time="0">Bolu, you light up my days,</p>
    <p data-time="5">Elizabeth, your smile's like a melody,</p>
    <p data-time="10">Weird and wonderful in every way,</p>
    <p data-time="15">Every moment with you is my remedy.</p>
    <p data-time="22">I met you in July at a friend’s party,</p>
    <p data-time="28">Laughing so bright, it stole my heart instantly,</p>
    <p data-time="34">From that night, I knew you’re one of a kind,</p>
    <p data-time="40">A mix of magic, mischief, and sunshine.</p>
